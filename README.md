##Overview

**WishDish** is a local restaurant ordering application that is designed to suggest the top 3 closest restaurants based on what food you are craving. As a user you just have to choose out of the three. This app is similar to Grubhub, UberEATS, DoorDash and Caviar, however, the idea of this app was to tackle the paradox of choice problem when it comes to ordering food in Philly, especially on a local delivery food service app. This application was designed in about 2 weeks at the Pennovation Center in Philadelphia.

##Technologies Used

* Bulma
* JQuery
* Google Maps API
* Zomato API
* Font Awesome


##User Stories Completed

* As a user I should be able to search what I want to eat and see the closest 3 restaurants that have that food in the cards below.
* As a user I should be able to see restaurants highlighted on the Map where the suggested restaurants are.
